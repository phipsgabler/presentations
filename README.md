This repository contains the (CS-related) presentations for some of the talks (as well as posters) I gave at work and during my studies.

## [Master's thesis midterm presentation](./master-thesis-midterm)

Collection of ideas what I was gonna do during my master's thesis: background from automatic differentiation, SSA IR transformations, computation graph extraction.

The final presentation of the work above: background, description of the implementation of the computation graph extraction, and application for computation of Gibbs conditionals. 

## [Designing Plots](./designing_plots)

A talk about basic principles to design nice plots, with a very short introduction into the concepts of the Grammar of Graphics and some practical hints.  Given at the PhD seminar.

## [Introduction to causality](./causality_intro)

Really basic "what causal inference can do for you" presentation at work.

## [Conversational LMs](./conversational_lms)

Very early draft of my ideas for conversational language models -- what later evolved into the next talk.

## [A causal perspective on the data generation process of conversational speech data](./graz_wien_workshop)

A talk given at the Graz-Wien Speech Workshop 2021, summarizing my ideas about how to structure models for conversational speech data.

## [PhD Retreat 2021 Poster](./phd_retreat)

Poster summarizing the above concepts, presented internally at the ISDS/Know-Center PhD retreat (still only a sketch of my ideas).
