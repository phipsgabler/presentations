This repository contains the (CS-related) presentations for some of the talks (as well as posters) I gave at work and during my studies.

## [Bachelor's thesis final presentation](./bachelor-thesis-final)

Final presentation for my bachelor's thesis, [https://github.com/phipsgabler/bachelor-thesis](https://github.com/phipsgabler/bachelor-thesis).

## [Plurality Points](https://github.com/phipsgabler/algdesign-plurality-points/)

Talk given at the Algorithm Design Seminar about "Computing Plurality Points and Condorcet Points in Euclidean Space" (Wu et al., 2013).

Included here as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## [Persistent Data Structures](https://github.com/phipsgabler/algdesign-persistent-data-structures)

Talk given at the Algorithm Design Seminar about persistent and immutable data structures, especially HAMTs etc.

Included here as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## [Master's thesis midterm presentation](./master-thesis-midterm)

Collection of ideas what I was gonna do during my master's thesis: background from automatic differentiation, SSA IR transformations, computation graph extraction.

## [Master's thesis final presentation](./master-thesis-final)

The final presentation of my master's thesis, [Automatic Graph Tracking in Dynamic Probabilistic Programs via Source
Transformations](https://github.com/phipsgabler/master-thesis): background, description of the implementation of the computation graph extraction, and application for computation of Gibbs conditionals. 

## [Beyond Overdubbing](https://github.com/phipsgabler/beyond_overdubbing)

My talk at JuliaCon 2020, about the kinds of source transformations I was using in the implementation of [IRTracker.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/IRTracker.jl) for my master's thesis, and some speculative outlook.

Included here as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## [Designing Plots](./designing_plots)

A talk about basic principles to design nice plots, with a very short introduction into the concepts of the Grammar of Graphics and some practical hints.  Given at my PhD seminar.

## [Introduction to causality](./causality_intro)

Really basic "what causal inference can do for you" presentation at work.

## [Conversational LMs](./conversational_lms)

Very early draft of my ideas for conversational language models -- what later evolved into the next talk.

## [A causal perspective on the data generation process of conversational speech data](./graz_wien_workshop)

A talk given at the Graz-Wien Speech Workshop 2021, summarizing my ideas about how to structure models for conversational speech data.

## [PhD Retreat 2021 Poster](./phd_retreat)

Poster summarizing the above concepts, presented internally at the ISDS/Know-Center PhD retreat (still only a sketch of my ideas).

## [Deep leaning without math](./deep_learning)

An introduction to deep learning given at the linguistics department of Graz University to a general audience.

## [BUGS talks](./BUGS)

Slides for the discussion sessions about BUGS, Turing.jl, and AbstractPPL.jl.

## [Open Source as PhD](./os_as_phd)

Talk for my PhD seminar about using and participating in open source projects as PhD student.

## [Advanced Information Theory](./advanced_information_theory)

Presentation for the Advanced Information Theory seminar at TU Graz about the paper [Learning with Succinct Common Representation Based on Wyner's Common Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10945).
